With easy installation and customization thanks to the LESS/SASS files included and the custom themes colors ready to use. \r This skin is based on a material design and also extends the styles directly applied to Bootstrap files. Thereâ€™s no overwritten rules or bloating CSS, making a lightweight skin as Boostrap is itself.",
